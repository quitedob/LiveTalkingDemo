# Connection Stability Fixes Test Plan

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`/workspace/LiveTalking/api/control_api.py`)
1. **Extended Grace Period**: Increased `GRACE_TTL_SECONDS` from 120 to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
2. **Removed Aggressive Cleanup**: Changed "failed" and "closed" state handling to be less aggressive
3. **Better State Logging**: Improved logging for better debugging

### Frontend Changes

#### WebRTC1.html
1. **Manual Reconnect Button**: Added a "手动重连" button that appears when connection fails
2. **Improved State Handling**: Connection state changes now show/hide reconnect button appropriately
3. **User-Controlled Reconnection**: Removed automatic disconnection logic
4. **Better User Feedback**: Improved toast messages to inform users about connection status

#### Client.js
1. **Removed Auto-Disconnect**: Removed automatic disconnection on failed/disconnected states
2. **Better Logging**: Improved console logging for debugging
3. **Wait for User Action**: Connection issues now wait for user action instead of auto-closing

#### Demo.js
1. **Disabled Auto-Reconnect**: Commented out aggressive automatic reconnection function
2. **Manual Control**: Users must manually click start button to reconnect
3. **Better Status Messages**: Improved status messages to guide users

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Normal Connection
1. Open webrtc1.html
2. Click "开始连接"
3. Verify connection establishes successfully
4. Check that heartbeat starts after connection

### Test 2: Network Interruption
1. Establish connection as in Test 1
2. Simulate network interruption (disconnect WiFi briefly)
3. **Expected**: 
   - Connection state changes to "disconnected" or "failed"
   - "手动重连" button appears
   - Session is preserved for 5 minutes
   - No automatic disconnection

### Test 3: Manual Reconnection
1. After Test 2, click "手动重连" button
2. **Expected**:
   - Reconnection attempt starts
   - If successful, connection resumes with same session ID
   - Button disappears after successful reconnection

### Test 4: Page Refresh
1. Establish connection
2. Refresh the page
3. Click "开始连接" again
4. **Expected**:
   - New session created (different session ID)
   - Old session eventually cleaned up after grace period

### Test 5: Extended Grace Period
1. Establish connection
2. Simulate network failure
3. Wait for more than 5 minutes without reconnecting
4. **Expected**:
   - Session remains available for 5 minutes
   - After 5 minutes, session is cleaned up
   - Logs show "会话 XXXX 宽限到期，释放虚拟人实例"

## Success Criteria

✅ **Connection Stability**: Connections don't auto-disconnect on temporary network issues
✅ **User Control**: Users have manual control over reconnection
✅ **Grace Period**: 5-minute grace period for session recovery
✅ **Clear Feedback**: Users get clear messages about connection status
✅ **Session Preservation**: Sessions persist through temporary disconnections
✅ **Manual Recovery**: Users can manually trigger reconnection when needed

## Expected Log Output

```
INFO:logger:连接状态变为: connecting
INFO:logger:连接状态变为: connected
INFO:logger:连接状态变为: disconnected
INFO:logger:会话 XXXXXX 进入 disconnected，启动宽限计时 300s，等待重连...
# User manually reconnects or waits
INFO:logger:会话 XXXXXX 宽限到期，释放虚拟人实例 (if no reconnection)
```

## Notes for Testing

- The grace period is now 5 minutes instead of 2 minutes
- Manual reconnection is the primary method for recovery
- Backend preserves sessions longer, giving users more time to reconnect
- Frontend provides clear visual feedback about connection status
